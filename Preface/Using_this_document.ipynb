    "The recommend starting point is the website [https://speechprocessingbook.aalto.fi/](https://speechprocessingbook.aalto.fi/). This gives very easy access to most content in the book. \n",
    "\n",
    "To try out the code-examples and to get full access to all interactive demonstrations, we offer the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Directly from the [website](https://speechprocessingbook.aalto.fi/) with code-examples and interactive components through [Mybinder](https://mybinder.org/) or [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). (Disclaimer: Mybinder is often slow and on Colab some notebooks do not currently work.) To use this feature, click on the rocket-shaped logo on top of the page. \n",
    "2. Download the book from GitHub [https://github.com/Speech-Interaction-Technology-Aalto-U/itsp](https://github.com/Speech-Interaction-Technology-Aalto-U/itsp). Run JupyterLab on a [local server](content:localserver).\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of running the code yourself include:\n",
    "- You can change parameters and code to see how that changes behaviour.\n",
    "- You can use your own sound files (such as recording of your own voice) in both code-examples and interactive visualizations.\n"
